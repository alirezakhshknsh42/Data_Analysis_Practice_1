Title: Sales Data Visualization

Description:
This Python script generates bar graphs to visualize sales data by product categories. It provides various graphical representations, including a simple bar graph, a colored bar graph, a horizontal bar graph, and a 3D bar graph. Each graph represents the sales amounts of different product categories.

Libraries Used:
- numpy: For numerical operations and working with arrays.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib: For plotting and data visualization.
- mpl_toolkits: For creating a 3D plot.

How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
3. Save the provided code in a file named `plot.py`.
4. Run the following command in the terminal:
   python plot.py

Upon running the script, you will see different bar graphs representing sales amounts by product categories.

Code Structure:
- Importing necessary libraries.
- Setting global font family for the plots.
- Specifying product categories and sales amounts.
- Plotting a basic bar graph representing sales amounts by product categories.
- Modifying the bar graph by changing the colors of the bars.
- Creating a horizontal bar graph.
- Modifying the y-axis ticks to represent sales amounts in lakhs.
- Creating a 3D bar graph to represent sales amounts by product categories.

Output:
The script will generate various bar graphs to visualize the sales amounts of different product categories and display them individually.
